# Files Provided:
## Pre-trained Models weights:
## Face detection models used 
Haar Cascade Classifier (haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml):
Used for face detection in video streams.
YOLOv8n Model (yolov8n-face.pt):
An alternative face detection model, which can be used in place of the Haar Cascade Classifier for more accurate face detection.

## Age Prediction Model (age_deploy.prototxt and age_net.caffemodel):
These files constitute a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) model for predicting the age of individuals from facial images.
## Gender Prediction Model (gender_deploy.prototxt and gender_net.caffemodel):
These files comprise a pre-trained CNN model for predicting the gender of individuals from facial images.
## Trained Gender Model (CNN_gender_model.h5):
This is a trained deep learning model for predicting gender from facial images.
## Trained Age Model (CNN_age_model.h5):
This is a trained deep learning model for predicting age from facial images.
